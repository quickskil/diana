## Writing Tips
- Keep language benefits-first: more leads, higher conversion, automated handling of calls/messages, no lost opportunities.
- Mention Dominican Republic market fit when relevant (localization, bilingual support, targeting). 
- Emphasize self-onboarding and transparency.
- Avoid referencing a standalone "funnel" service; describe conversion systems instead.
